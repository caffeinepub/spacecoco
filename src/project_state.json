    "Project pivot: replace used-items marketplace with a Snake-style multiplayer web game on Internet Computer called \"Spacecoco\".",
    "Multiplayer target: up to 8 players with real-time state synchronization.",
    "Use ICP wallet integration for cosmetic skin selection/switching.",
    "Leaderboard should be stored/validated on-chain.",
    "User-approved scope change: replace (not just add) existing sprite/visual assets with a new arcade pixel-art style (neon snake, UFO/cow, starfield, VFX).",
    "User-approved scope change: replace existing music direction/system content with more modern, high-energy tracks (\"GTA V\" vibe).",
    "Gameplay tweak requested: snake should always be in motion; growth primarily from eating UFOs; cows/penguins provide bonus points; add animated crocodile entities.",
    "New art direction request: move from arcade pixel-art replacement to a higher-detail retro-cartoon neon look (very bright/‘expensive’) using web-feasible rendering (WebGL/WebGPU postprocessing; no Vulkan/true ray tracing/HDR10).",
    "New UX request: highly animated splash/home/menu presentation with UFOs/aliens and cows firing lasers for an immediate ‘wow’ effect.",
    "New gameplay request: competitive elimination—body hits opponent head => opponent resets to normal size; winner can collect dropped points to grow/score."
