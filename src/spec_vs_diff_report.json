  "summary": "Diff implements early WebAudio initialization with a one-time user-gesture unlock on PlayPage, adds a DPR scaling utility for crisp canvas rendering, and updates obstacle rendering to provide clearer UFO/penguin/alien silhouettes with texture-backed overlays and fallbacks. However, the diff summary is truncated for key loop code and does not show explicit focus/visibility pause/resume handling for the RAF loop, nor does it show the actual required new texture image assets being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-49",
      "requirement": "Enforce a stable 60fps game loop target and add focus/visibility handling so the game loop is paused/stopped when the tab/app loses focus and is resumed when focus returns, without causing blank renders or duplicated loops.",
      "reason": "useGameLoop.ts is truncated right as RAF loop logic starts; the diff summary provides no evidence of document visibilitychange/window blur handlers, nor evidence that the loop is stopped and restarted cleanly without duplicated RAF callbacks after multiple hide/show cycles.",

      "requirement": "Generate and include new high-detail toon textures under frontend/public/assets/generated and wire them into the existing toon texture loader/rendering pipeline.",
