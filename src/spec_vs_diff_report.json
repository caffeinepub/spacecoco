  "summary": "Implemented an animated neon start/menu canvas scene and updated Home/Lobby pages to use it; revamped HUD styling with large neon digits; added neon palette/glow CSS/Tailwind utilities; enhanced gameplay VFX (laser glow/trail, explosions, point-drop rendering, score popup rendering); and upgraded SFX playback with WebAudio-based stereo panning while respecting mute. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the required generated image assets were actually added under frontend/public/assets/generated, nor does it clearly show (due to truncation) the full competitive scoring/elimination logic (head-vs-body elimination, respawn to initial length, point-drop spawning/collection and growth, and score updates for cows/penguins) being implemented end-to-end.",
