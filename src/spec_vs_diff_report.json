However, the actual PNG asset is not shown as added, and PlayPage changes are truncated such that integration/conditional full-screen overlay behavior cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not show any new file added under frontend/public/assets/generated, so existence of the required PNG asset cannot be verified.",

      "requirement": "On /play before the game starts, show a full-viewport start overlay using the new cover image with subtle animated neon glow/motion, keeping UI readable and clickable, and ensuring previous cover is no longer visible.",
      "reason": "NeonStartCoverOverlay is created and imported in PlayPage, but the PlayPage diff is truncated before showing render logic. There is no visible evidence that the overlay is actually rendered conditionally when the game has not started, fills the viewport, or replaces the prior start/cover background.",
